    Ever since I started looking for work, something has become extremely clear &ndash; while I am familiar with the practical aspects of software design and development, a lot of the theoretical patterns are beyond fuzzy.
To address this, I have gone back to studying some of the basic design patterns and principles, starting with SOLID, which came to light in the early 2000s.
Single Responsibility Principle The first of these five software design principles is the &ldquo;Single Responsibility Principle&rdquo;.
