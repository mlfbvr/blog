    Software development is dead. We&rsquo;ve all heard it. But is it true? My opinion is that it depends on how you define software development.
If for you software development means sitting down with Vim or Visual Studio Code and writing APIs from scratch with ExpressJS, then yes, it&rsquo;s dead. AI can do that. Better? Unlikely, but just as good as you. Faster? Way faster than you.
Today, you tell an AI tool that you need an API to query and manage customer profiles.

    Ever since I started looking for work, something has become extremely clear &ndash; while I am familiar with the practical aspects of software design and development, a lot of the theoretical patterns are beyond fuzzy.
To address this, I have gone back to studying some of the basic design patterns and principles, starting with SOLID, which came to light in the early 2000s.
Single Responsibility Principle The first of these five software design principles is the &ldquo;Single Responsibility Principle&rdquo;.
