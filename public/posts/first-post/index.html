  <p>Hello and welcome to my personal blog! My name is Martin Lefebvre, and I&rsquo;m a full-stack software developer with a passion for technology that has spanned over two decades. With 20 years in software development and 30 years of experience with Linux, I&rsquo;ve had a front-row seat to the incredible evolution of our industry. This blog is where I&rsquo;ll be sharing my insights, experiences, and thoughts on the ever-changing world of tech.</p>
<p>My journey in the tech world began not as a developer, but in technical support. From 1999 to 2008, I was on the front lines, helping people navigate the worlds of dial-up, DSL, and mobile services. This experience gave me a deep appreciation for the end-user and the importance of creating software that is not just powerful, but also intuitive and reliable.</p>
<p>In 2008, I transitioned into a full-stack software developer role at my former employer, where I&rsquo;ve spent 16 years designing, building, and supporting a wide range of custom applications. From real-time data analysis to financial reporting and automation, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work on projects that have a real impact on the business. I&rsquo;m particularly proud of having led initiatives to migrate legacy applications to a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes, as well as hardening the security of multiple platforms.</p>
<p>My toolkit is a mix of the old and the new, from C/C++ and Perl to Python, React/NextJS, and a variety of relational and NoSQL databases. I&rsquo;m a firm believer in continuous learning and have always strived stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not in front of a computer, you can find me cycling, enjoying music, or out on the water fishing. I&rsquo;m also a huge advocate for IT and security, and I&rsquo;m always looking for ways to improve my and skills in these areas.</p>
<p>In this blog, I hope to share some of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned over the years, as well as my thoughts on the future of software development, security, and the tech industry as a whole. I&rsquo;m excited to start this new chapter and I hope you&rsquo;ll join me on this journey.</p>
