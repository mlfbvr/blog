## Welcome
I welcome you to my first blog post on my first blog. Here you will find random thoughts, tech and development tips I find interesting, and other fun things (for me).

## How it's done
I'm a geek and a nerd at heart so I'm not going the "easy" way. I'm giving credit to [Networkchuck](https://networkchuck.com/) for the idea.

### Obsidian
Posts are in a "Blog" directory in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (click the link to learn more).

### Hugo
The web-site itself is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast open-source static web-site generator written in Go.

### Hosting
GitHub pages allows us to host a static web-site from a GitHub repository so this seems like a great fit.
