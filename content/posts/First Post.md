Hello and welcome to my personal blog! My name is Martin Lefebvre, and I'm a full-stack software developer with a passion for technology that has spanned over two decades. With 20 years in software development and 30 years of experience with Linux, I've had a front-row seat to the incredible evolution of our industry. This blog is where I'll be sharing my insights, experiences, and thoughts on the ever-changing world of tech.

My journey in the tech world began not as a developer, but in technical support. From 1999 to 2008, I was on the front lines, helping people navigate the worlds of dial-up, DSL, and mobile services. This experience gave me a deep appreciation for the end-user and the importance of creating software that is not just powerful, but also intuitive and reliable.

In 2008, I transitioned into a full-stack software developer role at my former employer, where I've spent 16 years designing, building, and supporting a wide range of custom applications. From real-time data analysis to financial reporting and automation, I've had the opportunity to work on projects that have a real impact on the business. I'm particularly proud of having led initiatives to migrate legacy applications to a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes, as well as hardening the security of multiple platforms.

My toolkit is a mix of the old and the new, from C/C++ and Perl to Python, React/NextJS, and a variety of relational and NoSQL databases. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and have always strived stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me cycling, enjoying music, or out on the water fishing. I'm also a huge advocate for IT and security, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my and skills in these areas.

In this blog, I hope to share some of the lessons I've learned over the years, as well as my thoughts on the future of software development, security, and the tech industry as a whole. I'm excited to start this new chapter and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
